If you dont want to use HHD and prefer inputplumber and the cachyos kernel without bazzite kernel you can use the AllyX_Inputplumber install.sh to configure powercontrol for your fans, TDP and RGB 

To Install the script make it executable then type 
```
chmod +x AllyX_Inputplumber.sh
./AllyX_Inputplumber.sh
```
